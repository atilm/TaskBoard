# Task Board

Task Board is a desktop application which lets you organize your work in projects and tasks, 
track your progress and assess the accuracy of your time estimates. You create several projects,
assign tasks to these projects and estimate how long the task will take. Task Board measures the
actual time you spend working on each task and generates several charts from the gathered information.
See e.g., how many hours you worked on a project during the last weeks or how the errors of your time estimates
are distributed.
